if you want to create the effect of a detailed picture but don't have room for
 a lot of details, the trick is to choose the right ones. Choose details that
 suggest the rest. The fact that our doomed hero's hotel room has a king-size
d bed, two dressers, a desk, and a desk chair doesn't paint a mental picture
 of any specific place. A burnt-out fluorescent ceiling light does -- this is
 not the Ritz. An ugly hotel hotel room and an alligator attack -- our poor hero!

Trapped in the hotel room, the hero scrambled for the door, frantically trying  to avoid the alligator in the room with him, only to find that it was locked from the outside. It seems like he would have to find another way out.

The hero in the hotel with no way to figure out what he was doing there.
