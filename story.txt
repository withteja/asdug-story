if you want to create the effect of a detailed picture but don't have room for
 a lot of details, the trick is to choose the right ones. Choose details that
 suggest the rest. The fact that our doomed hero's hotel room has a king-size
d bed, two dressers, a desk, and a desk chair doesn't paint a mental picture
 of any specific place. A burnt-out fluorescent ceiling light does -- this is
 not the Ritz. An ugly hotel hotel room and an alligator attack -- our poor hero!
